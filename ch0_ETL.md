## The ETL Process

ADD OVERVIEW

## Extracting

Data in the real-world rarely comes diectly in a nice CSV or JSON file, but from many heterogeneous data sources each from various places
which must be processed at the same time and changed into a usable form. This is what we mean by ***Extract***: we must pull 
this data from these sources. These sources can include:
  1. PDFs
    - Includng such things as PDFs of forms which include images of handwritten notes within them
  2. Human Readable Excel Spreadsheets (or Google Sheets or etc)
    - These are different then Well-Formatted Spreadsheets because they are not organized in a way that computers can easily read
  3. Proper (well formatted) or Improper XML (XML that doesnâ€™t follow standard)
    - Or its cousin: HTML
  4. Images
  5. Sound Recordings
  6. JSON or CSVs or text files
  7. Full Databases
    - Its actually really common to have a number of individual (local) SQLite DBs that you merge into a single DB
  8. A host of other sources
  
So a typical extraction task may be to pull all the data from networked registers in the form of transcation 
"journals" (DBs or tables) and online sales using various libraries and then staging them for the "Transformation" process.
